# Equalizer Academy

Join us in learning, exploring and building decentralised ecosystems. The
Equalizer Academy is for everyone who wants to learn about blockchain and
Decentralised Finance (DeFi).

We cover the following topics

- Block processing
- EVM and Smart Contracts
- Flash Loans
- Arbitrage, Liquidation and Collateral swap
- Trading arbitrage strategies
- Trading automation or trading bots

Every two weeks, we organise an online meeting where we introduce the topics,
hold discussions or have hands-on workshops. We share the agenda and learning
materials before the meeting.

The Equalizer Academy working group is open, meaning that everyone can propose
new agenda items, topics or workshops. You can propose a new topic via our Discord channel.

To learn how to contribute, see the [How to contribute?](how-to-contribute.md) guidelines.
